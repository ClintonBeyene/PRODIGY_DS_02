# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an econometric analysis of the factors determining survival during the sinking of the Titanic. The analysis challenges the simplistic model of selfish homo oeconomicus and provides insights into the social norms and economic principles that influenced survival rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers, such as their age, gender, cabin class, and survival status.

## Analysis Summary
The analysis reveals that:
- Women and children had higher survival rates, reflecting the social norm of "saving women and children first."
- Younger individuals and those with higher financial means, particularly first and second-class passengers, had better survival rates.
- Crew members involved in rescue operations had higher survival rates due to their access to critical information and resources.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, particularly in the `Cabin` column, and categorized cabin information.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized survival rates based on different features such as gender, age, and cabin class using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
3. **Econometric Analysis**: Applied econometric models to understand the impact of various factors on survival rates.

## Key Findings
- **Social Norms**: Women and children had a better chance of survival, supporting the "women and children first" norm.
- **Sociobiological Factors**: Women of reproductive age and those with children were more likely to be saved.
- **Economic Factors**: Younger individuals and wealthier passengers (first and second-class) had better survival rates.
- **Crew Members**: Those involved in rescue operations had higher survival rates due to better access to information and resources.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to illustrate the findings:
- Bar plots comparing survival rates by cabin category.
- Distribution plots for age and gender.
- Heatmaps showing correlations between different variables.

## How to Run the Analysis
